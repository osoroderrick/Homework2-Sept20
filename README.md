Reading Notes

1)A Class is the blueprint for an object
2)Every instance of a particular class has the same methods can behave differently based on the value of the instance variables
3)Arguments/Parameters are the values passed into a method
4)If you declare a return value, you must return a value of declared type
5)A getter's sole purpose is to send back, as a return value
6)Setter takes an argument and sets the value of the instance variable 
7)Mark instance variables private
8)Mark getters and setters as public
9)Abstract class has no use unless its extended 
10)Class that is not abstract is concrete
11)Abstarct method has no body
12)If you declare an abstract method you must mark the class abstract as well.
13)You must implement all abstract methods
14)Every Class in Java extends class Object
15)Classes from different interface tree can implement the same interface
16)all objects live in the heap
17)The method on the top of the stack is always the crrently executing method
